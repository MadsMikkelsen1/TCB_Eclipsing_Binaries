## Period of Eclipsing Binaries for the star TIC293937699

This repository serves as a collaborative workplace for the group working on the period of eclipsing binaries.
To download and contribute:

1) "Git clone" the project into your desired folder on your computer (this can be done by typing "cd" into your terminal until you reach the desired folder). The terminal should look something like this
$ git clone https://github.com/MadsMikkelsen1/TCB_Eclipsing_Binaries.git
$ cd TCB_Eclipsing_Binaries/

2) To avoid messing up our "master" code so that we always have a backup in case something goes wrong, when implementing a new feature / code, add it as a new "branch"
$ git co -b NAME_OF_BRANCH
$ git branch (to verify you're in the correct branch)

3) Push your code to GitHub where we will merge additions to the "master" branch
$ git push
